Demo client to show usage of rock paper scissors backend

It is a very simple web app coded with Node JS, express and edge. 

Disclaimer: it's a very simple and rudimentary web client to show the backend functionality, and to satisfy the proposed statement.

## How to make it run

Having node and npm is a previous requirement. 
This commands will download it's dependencies:
```
npm install
npm start
```
And then the project will be accesible in 

```
http://localhost:8081
```

This expects the backend to be running on port 8080.
